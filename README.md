# Time-Series-Forecasting-using-TBATS-Model
To forecast the hourly traffic volume on an interstate highway having complex seasonal patterns based on Tbats model.

1) Analysing the considered dataset to understand the internal structures of time series

2) The dataset possessed two seasonal periods, daily seasonality and weekly seasonality. Identified the factors that the emphasize the requirement of Tbats model for this scenario.

3) The forecast horizon was considered with a length of 168 hours for forecasting next one week hourly traffic volume

4) Fitted the BATS and TBATS models against naive forecast baseline. Analysed the outcomes of the model for the best fit. 

5) This forecasting model can be applicable across other prominent use cases like retail store hourly footfall, hotel room demand planning etc.
